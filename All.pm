=head1 NAME

Bundle::POE::All - Installs all the modules in the POE::* namespace

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will use CPANPLUS to retrieve all the modules under the POE::* namespace and install them.

This file, All.pm, is merely a placeholder and will be overwritten with a CONTENTS section when Makefile.PL
is run, thanks to the magic of CPANPLUS :)
